# Periodic Elemental 2048

Periodic Elemental 2048 is periodic table elements inspired games based on the famous 2048 game.

Here instead of numbers, we have symbols of the  elements which combined together to form higher periodic table elements.

My Main aim was to make learning fun instead of boring.
