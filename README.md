# Periodic Elemental 2048

Periodic Elemental 2048 is periodic table elements inspired games based on the famous 2048 game.

Here instead of numbers, we have symbols of the  elements which combined together to form higher periodic table elements.

My Main aim was to make learning fun instead of boring. Here aim is to learn chemical reaction via playing 2048.

## ToDo:

- [ ] Introduce level concepts (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3)
- [ ] Level 1 , Smaller Elements combines to form higher Elements
- [ ] Level 2 Introduction of Radicals and Combination of elements and radicals to form compounds e.g (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
- [ ] Level 3 Chemical Reaction between compounds e.g (HCl + NaOH -> Nacl + H<sub>2</sub>0)
- [X] Elements till Potassium has been introduced
- [ ] Elements after Potassium to be introduced
- [ ] Concepts of Inert Gases can be introduced and they will not do anything when combined with other elements showing their inertness to reactions.
- [ ] Further Suggestions to improve
